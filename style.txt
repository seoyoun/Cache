Style Grade: 7/10
-1: line 291 over 80 chars
-2: return values are magic numbers as they indicate the state your program exits in; setting dirty/valid bits to 1/0, 1/0 are magic numbers as they indicate the state of your cache line; whenever you index into an array with a constant index, that index is a magic number as it corresponds to a special element in that array (i.e. line 236); -1 on line 47 is a magic number as it indicates we have no more arguments left to parse

Style Comments:
- make sure your comments don't exceed 80 chars either
- use the \ delimiter to split up Long lines
- use #define constants for your magic numbers, i.e. #define DIRTY 1, #define CLEAN 0, or for return values #define SUCCESS 0, #define BAD_ALLOC -1, #define BAD_FOPEN -2, etc. Essentially, whenever you use a constant in your code, think "can I make this more readable by naming it with a #define constant." For example on line 109, you could have done if (i == MRU), where #define MRU 0
- make sure you have a unique non-zero return value for each kind of error you may encounter in the program
- nice file header, great function headers!
- put your function declarations at the top of the file, implement them at the bottom
- make sure you don't forget to return after an error occurs, i.e. on line 281 if you can't open the trace file
